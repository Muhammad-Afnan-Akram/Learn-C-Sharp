    <p><strong>Choosing between interfaces and abstract classes depends on the specific design needs and the relationships between your classes. Here's a breakdown of when to use interfaces and when to use abstract classes:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Use Interfaces When:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unrelated Classes Need a Common Contract: When you have multiple unrelated classes that need to adhere to a common contract (method and property signatures), use interfaces. Interfaces allow these classes to share behavior without enforcing a specific inheritance hierarchy.</li>
        <li>Promote Loose Coupling: If you want to achieve loose coupling between classes, use interfaces. By defining contracts through interfaces, classes can interact based on those contracts rather than specific implementations.</li>
        <li>Multiple Inheritance of Behavior: If a class needs to inherit behavior from multiple sources, use interfaces. C# supports multiple interface implementation, allowing a class to inherit functionality from various unrelated sources.</li>
        <li>Defining Contracts and Compatibility: Use interfaces when you want to define a contract that multiple classes must adhere to, ensuring compatibility even when the classes have distinct implementations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Use Abstract Classes When:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shared Behavior with Default Implementations: If you have a base class that provides shared behavior along with default implementations, use an abstract class. Abstract classes allow you to provide a combination of methods with concrete implementations and placeholders for derived classes to override.</li>
        <li>Single Inheritance Hierarchy: If you're working within a single inheritance hierarchy, where classes are conceptually related and share common behaviors, an abstract class can serve as a logical base class with both default implementations and placeholders for derived classes.</li>
        <li>Common Data and Members: If you want to provide common fields, properties, and methods that multiple derived classes can inherit, an abstract class is a suitable choice. Abstract classes allow you to define these members with various access modifiers.</li>
        <li>Constructor Implementation and Chaining: If you need to define constructors, participate in constructor chaining, or enforce certain patterns when creating objects, use abstract classes. Abstract classes can have constructors that derived classes can chain to.</li>
        <li>Gradual Enhancement: If you anticipate that derived classes might need to incrementally enhance or override behavior over time, abstract classes provide a mechanism for gradual development and enhancement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Guiding Principles:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Favor Interfaces for Contracts: Use interfaces when you want to define contracts, promote loose coupling, and allow multiple unrelated classes to share behavior.</li>
        <li>Favor Abstract Classes for Shared Behavior: Use abstract classes when you need to provide shared behavior with default implementations and placeholders for derived classes to override, particularly within a single inheritance hierarchy.</li>
        <li>Consider Composition: In some cases, a combination of interfaces and composition (having a property of an interface type) can provide a flexible and maintainable design.</li>
        <li>Design Flexibility: The decision between interfaces and abstract classes should align with the specific needs of your application's design and architecture. Consider the trade-offs and benefits of each approach based on your use case.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In general, carefully analyze your application's requirements, the relationships between classes, and the need for shared behavior to make an informed decision on whether to use interfaces, abstract classes, or a combination of both.</p>
